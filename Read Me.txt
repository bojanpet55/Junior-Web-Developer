Greatings Sir / Madame,

Let me say the project is not made in OOP design mainly due to TIME.

I had some OOP implemented but had to scratch it as I had already done most of the website before I even checked that it needed to be OOP.

I did include the OOP files as well as most of the files that I wrote.

I also had 3-4 extra pages for the website, but had to disable them for the QA tester ( They are the Product Deleted and Product 
Submitted pages ).

THE QA Did not recognize most of the IDS for some reason even though, they are as asked for, Soo intern the QA did not give me a 100% Finished work.

I Still decided to submit it because I am capable of solving the problems if I just had more time.

I know You insured me there was no time limit, I felt necessary to upload it as soon as possible.

INFO ABOUT FOLDERS:
