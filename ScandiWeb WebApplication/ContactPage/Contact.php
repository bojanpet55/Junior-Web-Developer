    <p class="poemName"><span class="titlePoem">“Missing”</span> by Anne Scott</p><br>
    <hr class="top">
    <p class="poems">I’ve hunted near, I’ve hunted far<br>
    I even looked inside my car.<br>
    I’ve lost my glasses, I’m in need,<br>
    To have them now, so I can read.<br>
    I loudly swear and I curse<br>
    Did I leave them in my purse?<br>
    Are they behind the sofa, under the bed?<br>
    Oh, there they are—on my head!<br>
    </p>

    <hr class="top">
    <p class="poems">Tinkle, Tinkle little car<br>
      How I wonder what you are.<br>
      Leaking oil every day<br>
      Having it your own way.<br>
      Going up hills real slow<br>
      I don't want you any mo'.<br>
      Tinkle, Tinkle little car<br>
      Boy, what a lemon you are.<br>

    <hr class="top">
    <p class="poems">All doggies go to heaven (or so I’ve been told).<br>
      They run and play along the streets of Gold.<br>
      Why is heaven such a doggie-delight?<br>
      Why, because there’s not a single cat in sight!<br>

    <hr class="top">
    <p class="poems">Roses are red.<br>
      Your blood is too.<br>
      You look like a monkey<br>
      And belong in a zoo.<br>
      Do not worry,<br>
      I'll be there too.<br>
      Not in the cage,<br>
      But laughing at you.<br>

      Some are different,<br>
      Some are the same,<br>
      Some are short,<br>
      Some are long,<br>
      All are right,<br>
      None are wrong,<br>
